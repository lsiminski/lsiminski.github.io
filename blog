		<p>Everything about the look of this website—from color and font choice, to the background images—is playful and makes it fun to scroll through.</p>

		When you scroll down the page, there are several color appearances when you put your arrow over certain things.</p>

		If it weren't for the warped images under "Main Partners" in the footer, I'd be 100% in love with that aspect of the site too. Other than that, the footer sums up the web page nicely, and the section to enter in your email is also playful and a unique touch.</p>

		<p>I <3 Unique Navigation<br>
		—</p>
		<br>
		<p>I stumbled upon this website a while ago and saved it to my bookmarks. While going through my bookmarks on my laptop, I was reminded of why I love the web design so much...</p>

		When you hover over the top navigation, there's a different illustration displayed, starting the viewer off with a cute, friendly welcome to the website.</p>

		When you scroll past the header image, there are smaller images underneath that also link to different things on the website. Some of these images are just one link, and some have multiple links within the image.</p>
		<br>
		<p><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2djc9w5.jpg"><br><br>
		Additionally, under those images, the display of their client names is very neat and clean, and serves as another form of navigation.</p>

		To end the design with a bang, their footer grid is very organized and just in case you missed a link somehow throughout the homepage navigation, most of the links you need to know are displayed at the footer.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My description doesn't do the website justice, so you should definitely check it out and see for yourself!</p>
